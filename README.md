# Project Overview

This folder contains three separate projects:

1. **Vacation Booking System**  
   A simple system to manage vacation bookings, implemented using functions and closures instead of the `class` keyword.

2. **Mini Language Interpreter**  
   An interpreter for a small, custom-designed programming language.

3. **TIG - Tiny Git**  
   A minimal version of the Git system, rebuilt from scratch for educational purposes.

Each project is in its own subfolder. Designed for learning and experimentation.
