we reviewed the file archiver discussed in class together and reviewed the functionlities we have to implement for our tig implementation

22.11.24

copied the file archiver to our main w our comments
started working on step and created some branches w our implementation of our code

26.11.24

continued working on our code together
decided to update our status functions so that it works correctly
implement the log - N functionality
and started working on diff and checkout as well
in order to implement modified and commited files in status function we "had" to create a new function (get_latest_commit_files) to make it easier to understand which we then used to implement the logic in the status function, which now differentiates between Modified and Staged files and Modified and Not Staged files.
for the diff function we used the library method which we had to looked up on the internet and familiarize with the usage 

27.11.24
after we implemented all functions we merged each branch into main and tested through all the steps. There were still some problems so we updated and debugged the functions until everything works.
